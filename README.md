High Music
==========

Overview
--------

High Music is a Python-based application that converts molecular structures into musical sequences. This project specifically focuses on representing the molecular model of estrogen through a series of musical notes, creating an auditory experience of chemical structures.

Features
--------

*   **Music Generation**: Converts predefined molecular structures into corresponding musical notes.
*   **Audio Playback**: Utilizes the Pygame library to play generated musical sequences.
*   **ASCII Art Visualization**: Displays the notes as ASCII art in the console as they are played, enhancing the user experience.

Motivation
----------

This project was inspired by the idea of exploring the intersection of science and art, particularly how molecular structures can be represented in different sensory formats. By translating the structure of estrogen into music, we provide a novel way of appreciating and understanding chemical compounds.

AI-Generated Code
-----------------

Portions of this code were generated with the assistance of an AI developed by OpenAI. This includes the algorithm for translating molecular structures into musical notes and some elements of the code for playing these notes. The AI's contributions were supervised and curated by human developers to ensure accuracy and functionality.

This sentence/paragragh is literally the only thing not generated and is coming straight from my actual ass brain. I am not sure I am high anymore, tbh.... mostly a good bit typsy on a good malbec or some other red. Very good. but ya, the code was generated using Chat GPTfor the most part, with me "holding it's hand" along the way. It actually compiles and runs which is pretty impressive, even if a bit... wonkily. I hope that some one can make use of this, and if you want to contribute, go for it!
